- You must set moduleNameMapper with ts-jest so that you can import from path aliases in the spec file
- Prefer ts-jest over babel-jest to transforming ts(x) files
- With next, you need to setup another tsconfig.test.json in order to set jsx: react instead of preserver, the drawback here is that I need to repeat all the tsconfig paths
